simultion findings:
    1. Rectifier can act as circuit isolator. The resonant frequancy will not be affected by the circuit after the rectifier.
    2. parallel resonator on reciever side will be hard to model(according to me) and also frequency splitting phenomenon will occur. 
    but in series resonator resonator frequency spiltting doesn't occur.
    ### Major disadvantege in seriess resnace is that the vltage produce across the resister is very small and also the current. But In case of parallel resonace the power is significantly transferred.

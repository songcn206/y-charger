How to use:
    Compile and run C++ code having same directry as the modified_sine_wave.txt file.
    then open the signal editor in TINA and go to piece wise linear signal.
    Now go to menu>>open>> choose the modified_sine_wave.txt.

    for changing the frequency and amplitute of the modified sine wave update the variable f and A in C++ code.
     each time when you run the program the .txt file gets updtated hence ach and every time whem any updatation is made choose the file again in the TINA signal editor.
     
 you can play around the code and change the functionality of the code

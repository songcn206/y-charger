1. Invertor
    1. need to decide wich type of invertor need to be designed(PQR/SQR/ModSQR)
        In case of PQR:
            1. topology
    2. then simulation
    3. fabrication on perfboard

2. Transmitter side Controller
    Tasks of Controller:
        invertor:
            1. inrush current prevention (not applicable for this particular application)
            2. current and voltage safty limits
            3. voltage regulation
            4. maximum power tracking ( resonance frequency tracking )
            5. combinning Controller with invertor 
        
        for communication:
            1. QI communication
            2. foriegn object and target detection
            
3. Transmitter and Receiver circuit:
    1. Theoratical model explaning the variation of different parameters(ex. efficiency, power transfer) with the circuiutal parameters.
    2. deciding optimum frequency, and circuital parameters, size shape and inductance of the coil  
    3. simulation
    4. making transmitter and reciever coil and fabrication

    then combining it with the invertor circuit

4. rectifier and buck-boost convertor intergration

5. Receiver side Controller
    1. current and voltage monitering circuit
    2. communication QI protocol
